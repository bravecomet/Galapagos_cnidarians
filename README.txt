When colder is better: Thermal performance trade-offs enable physiological resilience in upwelling-adapted Galápagos cnidariansThis repository contains the data, metadata, and R code used to quantify the thermal performance of Galápagos cnidarians**Study Description**: Understanding how temperature governs biological systems is increasingly urgent under climate change. For sessile ectotherms unable to track shifting thermal gradients, localized adaptation may be critical for persistence. Thermal performance curves describe the relationship between temperature and metabolic fitness, but species can exhibit different temperature–performance associations depending on environmental conditions and physiological traits. Classical theory, including the ‘hotter-is-better’ hypothesis, predicts organisms adapted to warmer environments achieve higher maximal performance (*P*<sub>max</sub>) at elevated thermal optima (*T*<sub>opt</sub>). While this pattern is well documented in terrestrial taxa, marine evidence remains inconsistent. We quantified respiration across a 20–36°C gradient for four Galápagos ahermatypic cnidarians: two octocorals (*Pacifigorgia* *darwinii*, *Muricea* *plantaginea*), the cup coral *Tubastraea* *coccinea*, and the sea anemone *Bunodosoma* *grande*. Based on thermal histories and morphologies, we predicted octocorals, would show lower *T*<sub>opt</sub> and *P*<sub>max</sub> compared to warm-adapted species. Contrary to expectations, cooler-adapted octocorals exhibited lower *T*<sub>opt</sub> (33.3–35.0°C) yet higher *P*<sub>max</sub> (3.8–4.0 ?mol O2 g<sup>?1</sup> h<sup>?1</sup>), supporting a ‘colder-is-better’ model. This trade-off may reflect adaptation to nutrient-rich upwelling environments characteristic of the Galápagos. Findings provide evidence for alternative thermal performance models in marine ecosystems and highlight how local specialization shapes metabolic resilience, persistence, and community structure under warming. Keywords: adaptive traits, climate resilience, ‘colder-is-better’ hypothesis, Galápagos Archipelago, metabolic trade-offs, octocorals, thermal performance, upwelling systemsAll statistical analyses were conducted in R v. 4.2.2**Folder/File Structure & Contents**Below contains a list of the associated datafiles and folders, woth descriptions of what lives in each:- Cni_respiration_files: Contains species' subfolders of raw, temperature-dependent O2 measurements across the experimental temperature gradient- Generated_rate_estimations: Contains processed, model-derived calculations of metabolic rates for each individual per species x temperature pairing- Scripts_Rfiles: The R scripts used to process the raw data, estimate rates, perform statistical analyses, and generate plots. Also included are produced raw data files- Cni_metadata.csv: The metadata for every individual in this study, which includes parameters like the start/stop time of each trial, chamber volume/channel, and ash free dry weight estimates- HOBO_temperature_data.csv: Environmental temperature records used to characterize the thermal history of locations where the cnidarians reside. Data collected includes 7/28/2019 - 1/7/2022 @ 15 min intervals- README.md: This main document, outlining the purpose, background, methods, and general information on packages and analyses**How to Run / Reproduce the Analyses**Below are step by step instructions to run analyses in this repository, including configuration and assumptions. Adjust paths or versions as needed.1. **Prerequisites**: Install R (version > 4.4.2). Ensure required R packages are available. From the README, these include (but may not be limited to): LoLinR, nls.multstart, lme4, plus any packages used for plotting (ggplot2, etc.). Make sure your working directory is the root of this repository (so paths in scripts will work, or adjust them accordingly).2. **Data Preparation**: Verify that raw respiration data files are present in 'Cni_respiration_files' and that the metadata file 'Cni_metadata.csv' is complete. Read in the raw data files to ensure they are properly picked up by the code3. **Rate Estimation & Analysis**: Run the scripts in the appropriate order; the 'Data_cleaning_rate_estimations.Rmd' code should be run first, as it establishes start/end timestamps for each of the raw data files (used to calculate rates) and normalizes to a variety of study components (incl. chamber water volume, tisse weight per specimen, and background respiration of empty control chambers). Once rates are mass-normalized, the 'TPC_derivation_and_analysis.Rmd' file is used to fit these calculated rates to a modified Sharpe-Schoolfield equation for high-temperature inactivation, wherein thermal performance parameters can be derived, outliers removed, and statistical analyses run on each linear model. Data quality is also checked through various methods, including histograms and QQ plots.4. **Reproducable Tables & Figures**: Both scripts include code used to generate relevant Tables (model summary stats, TukeyHSD comparisons) and Figures (thermal parameter mean plots, thermal performance curves (TPCs) by species, and a Pearson's correlation test of Topt-Pmax.**Configuration Parameters**- Temperature gradeint & species utilized- Working directory/file paths- R packages and versions- Thresholds for outlier removal: 1.5*SD was used herein- *LOLinR* params: alpha = 0.5 (proportion of total observations in the data set) and data thinning every 15 s
