# When colder is better: Thermal performance trade-offs enable physiological resilience in upwelling-adapted Galápagos cnidarians
Data and analysis for study on the thermal performance of Galápagos cnidarians

Understanding how temperature governs biological systems is increasingly urgent under climate change. For sessile ectotherms unable to track shifting thermal gradients, localized adaptation may be critical for persistence. Thermal performance curves describe the relationship between temperature and metabolic fitness, but species can exhibit different temperature–performance associations depending on environmental conditions and physiological traits. Classical theory, including the ‘hotter-is-better’ hypothesis, predicts organisms adapted to warmer environments achieve higher maximal performance (Pmax) at elevated thermal optima (Topt). While this pattern is well documented in terrestrial taxa, marine evidence remains inconsistent. We quantified respiration across a 20–36°C gradient for four Galápagos ahermatypic cnidarians: two octocorals (Pacifigorgia darwinii, Muricea plantaginea), the cup coral Tubastraea coccinea, and the sea anemone Bunodosoma grande. Based on thermal histories and morphologies, we predicted octocorals, would show lower Topt and Pmax compared to warm-adapted species. Contrary to expectations, cooler-adapted octocorals exhibited lower Topt (33.3–35.0°C) yet higher Pmax (3.8–4.0 μmol O2 g−1 h−1), supporting a ‘colder-is-better’ model. This trade-off may reflect adaptation to nutrient-rich upwelling environments characteristic of the Galápagos. Findings provide evidence for alternative thermal performance models in marine ecosystems and highlight how local specialization shapes metabolic resilience, persistence, and community structure under warming.
